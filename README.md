A new approach to Container-Based Dependency Injection for Swift and SwiftUI.

## Factory 2.0

Factory is strongly influenced by SwiftUI, and in my opinion is highly suited for use in that environment. Factory is...

- **Safe**: Factory is compile-time safe; a factory for a given type must exist or the code simply will not compile.
- **Flexible**: It's easy to override dependencies at runtime and for use in SwiftUI Previews.
- **Powerful**: Like Resolver, Factory supports application, cached, shared, and custom scopes, custom containers, arguments, decorators, and more.
- **Lightweight**: With all of that Factory is slim and trim, about 700 lines of actual code and half the size of Resolver.
- **Performant**: Little to no setup time is needed for the vast majority of your services, resolutions are extremely fast, and no compile-time scripts or build phases are needed.
- **Concise**: Defining a registration usually takes just a single line of code. Same for resolution.
- **Documented**: Factory 2.0 has extensive DocC documentation covering its classes, methods, and use cases.
- **Tested**: Unit tests with 100% code coverage helps ensure correct operation of registrations, resolutions, and scopes.
- **Free**: Factory is free and open source under the MIT License.

Sound too good to be true? Let's take a look.
  
 ## A Simple Example
 
Most container-based dependency injection systems require you to define in some way that a given service type is available for injection and many require some sort of factory or mechanism that will provide a new instance of the service when needed.
 
 Factory is no exception. Here's a simple dependency registration.
 
```swift
extension Container {
    var myService = Factory<MyServiceType> { 
        self { MyService() }
    }
}
```
Unlike Resolver which often requires defining a plethora of nested registration functions, or SwiftUI, where defining a new environment variable requires creating a new EnvironmentKey and adding additional getters and setters, here we simply add a new `Factory` to the default container. When called, the factory closure is evaluated and returns an instance of our dependency. That's it.

Injecting and using the service where needed is equally straightforward. Here's just one of the many ways Factory can be used.

```swift
class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Injected(\.myService) private var myService
    ...
}
```
Here this particular view model uses one of Factory's `@Injected` property wrappers to request the desired dependency. Similar to `@Environment` in SwiftUI, we provide the property wrapper with a keyPath to a factory of the desired type and it resolves that type the moment `ContentViewModel` is created.

And that's the core mechanism. In order to use the property wrapper you *must* define a factory. That factory *must* return the desired type when asked. Fail to do either one and the code will simply not compile. As such, Factory is compile-time safe.

 ## Inside Factory

Similar to a `View` in SwiftUI, a `Factory` is a lightweight struct that exists to define and manage a specific dependency. Just provide it with a closure that constructs and returns an instance of your dependency or service, and Factory will handle the rest.

```swift
extension Container {
    var myService = Factory<MyServiceType> { 
        self { MyService() }
    }
}
```
There's a few things going on here, so let's break it down. First, we extended our container in order to define a new computed variable of type `Factory<MyServiceType>`, where `MyServiceType` is the dependency type. In most situations that type is often a protocol to which the returned dependency conforms. 

```swift
extension Container {
    var service: Factory<MyServiceType> {
        ...
    }
}
```
So our computed variable needs to return a Factory. Factories have a couple of requirements: They need to communicate with their enclosing containers; and they need to be provided with a closure that can be called to create an instance of our dependency when required. 

As such, a complete, formal Factory definition would look like this...
```swift
var service: Factory<ServiceType> {
    Factory(self) { 
        MyService()
    }
}
```
But we can do better. As shown, Factory also provdides a little bit of syntactic sugar that lets us ask the enclosing container to make our factory for us.

```swift
var service: Factory<ServiceType> {
    self { MyService() }
}
```
And we're done. Either way, the Factory generated by the container is then returned directly to the caller, usually to be evaluated. See "Resolving a Factory" below.

If you're concerned about constructing Factory's on the fly, don't be. Like SwftUI Views, Factory structs and modifiers are lightweight and transitory value types. Ther're created when needed and then immediately discarded once their purpose has been served.

For more examples of Factory definitions that define scopes, use constructor injection, and do parameter passing, see: [Registrations](https://hmlongco.github.io/Factory/documentation/factory/registrations).

## Resolving Factories

Earlier we demonstrated how to use the ``Injected`` property wrapper. But it's also possible to bypass the property wrapper and talk to the factory yourself.

```swift
class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private let myService = Container.shared.myService()
    private let eventLogger = Container.shared.eventLogger()
    ...
}
```
Just call the desired specific factory as a function and you'll get an instance of its managed dependency. It's that simple.

If  you're into container-based dependency injection, note that you can also pass an instance of a container to a view model and obtain an instance of your service directly from that container.
```swift
class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    let service: MyServiceType
    init(container: Container) {
        service = container.service()
    }
}
```
Or if you want to use a Composition Root pattern, just use the container to provide the required dependencies to a constructor.

```swift
extension Container {
    var myRepository: Factory<MyRepositoryType> {
        self { MyRepository(service: self.networkService()) }
    }
    var networkService: Factory<Networking> {
        self { MyNetworkService() }
    }
}

@main
struct FactoryDemoApp: App {
    let viewModel = MyViewModel(repository: Container.shared.myRepository())
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            NavigationView {
                ContentView(viewModel: viewModel)
            }
        }
    }
}

```
Factory is flexible. See [Resolutions](https://hmlongco.github.io/Factory/documentation/factory/resolutions) for more examples.

## Mocking

If we go back and look at our original view model code one might wonder why we've gone to all of this trouble? Why not simply say `let myService = MyService()` and be done with it? 

Or keep the container idea, but write something similar to this…

```swift
extension Container {
    static var myService: MyServiceType { MyService() }
}
```

Well, the primary benefit one gains from using a container-based dependency injection system is that we're able to change the behavior of the system as needed. Consider the following code:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var model = ContentViewModel()
    var body: some View {
        Text(model.text())
            .padding()
    }
}
```

Our ContentView uses our view model, which is assigned to a StateObject. Great. But now we want to preview our code. How do we change the behavior of `ContentViewModel` so that its `MyService` dependency isn't making live API calls during development? 

It's easy. Just replace `MyService` with a mock that also conforms to `MyServiceType`.

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        let _ = Container.myService.register { MockService2() }
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

Note the line in our preview code where we’re gone back to our container and registered a new closure on our factory. This function overrides the default factory closure.

Now when our preview is displayed `ContentView` creates a `ContentViewModel` which in turn has a dependency on `myService` using the `Injected` property wrapper. 

And when the wrapper asks the factory for an instance of `MyServiceType` it now gets a `MockService2` instead of the `MyService` type originally defined.

This is a powerful concept that lets us reach deep into a chain of dependencies and alter the behavior of a system as needed.

## Testing

The same concept can be used used when writing unit tests. Consider the following.

```swift
final class FactoryCoreTests: XCTestCase {

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        Container.shared = Container()
    }
    
    func testLoaded() throws {
        Container.shared.accountProvider.register { MockProvider(accounts: .sampleAccounts) }
        let model = Container.shared.someViewModel()
        model.load()
        XCTAssertTrue(model.isLoaded)
    }

    func testEmpty() throws {
        Container.shared.accountProvider.register { MockProvider(accounts: []) }
        let model = Container.shared.someViewModel()
        model.load()
        XCTAssertTrue(model.isEmpty)
    }

    func testErrors() throws {
        Container.shared.accountProvider.register { MockProvider(error: .notFoundError) }
        let model = Container.shared.someViewModel()
        model.load()
        XCTAssertTrue(model.errorMessage = "Some Error")
    }
    
}
```
Again, Factory makes it easy to reach into a chain of dependencies and make specific changes to the system as needed. This makes testing loading states, empty states, and error conditions simple.

But we're not done yet. 

Factory has quite a few more tricks up its sleeve...

## Scope

If you've used Resolver or some other dependency injection system before then you've probably experienced the benefits and power of scopes.

And if not, the concept is easy to understand: Just how long should an instance of an object live?

You've no doubt stuffed an instance of a class into a variable and created a singleton at some point in your career. This is an example of a scope. A single instance is created and then used and shared by all of the methods and functions in the app.

This can be done in Factory just by adding a scope modifer.

```swift
extension Container {
    var myService = Factory<MyServiceType> { 
        self { MyService() }
            .singleton
    }
}
```
Now whenever someone requests an instance of `myService` they'll get the same instance of the object as everyone else.

Note that the client neither knows nor cares about the scope. Nor should it. The client is simply given what it needs when it needs it. 

If no scope is specified the default scope is unique. A new instance of the service will be instantiated and returned every time one is requested from the factory.

Other common scopes are `cached` and `shared`. Cached items are persisted until the cache is reset, while shared items exist just as long as someone holds a strong reference to them. When the last reference goes away, the weakly held shared reference also goes away.

Factory has other scope types, plus the ability to define your own. See [Scopes](https://hmlongco.github.io/Factory/documentation/factory/scopes) for additonal examples.

## Debugging

When running in DEBUG mode Factory allows you to trace the injection process and see every object created or returned during a given resolution cycle.
```
0: Factory.Container.cycleDemo = CycleDemo N:105553131389696
1:     Factory.Container.aService = AServiceType N:105553119821680
2:         Factory.Container.implementsAB = AServiceType & BServiceType N:105553119821680
3:             Factory.Container.networkService = NetworkService N:105553119770688
1:     Factory.Container.bService = BServiceType N:105553119821680
2:         Factory.Container.implementsAB = AServiceType & BServiceType C:105553119821680
```
